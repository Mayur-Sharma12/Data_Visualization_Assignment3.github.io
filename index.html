        <h4> About the Dataset </h4>
        <p> The dataset used is the 'Building Inventory Dataset' from https://data.illinois.gov/dataset/87building_inventory. It has a list of all in-use building in the state of illinois. 
        </p> 
        
        
        <p> 
            The following visualization tells us about which agency has the most square footage owned/acquired till date. A simple sorted bar plot shows the median square footage v/s the corresponding agency name.  The main motive of this visualization is to take a look at which agency has the most median square footage.

        <p>There is some level of interactivity. Upon hovering over the graph, detailed information about the specific bar pops up. On clicking a bar, it gets highlighted.
            
        <br><br>
            
        From the graph, it can be inferred that the top agencies with a higher median square footage cover a larger area with many buildings or with more floors. For example the 'Chicago State Univeristy' needs more area to accomodate students which can include seminar halls, athletic grounds or auditoriums. Let's take a look at one of the agencies with a lower median square footage, for example the Department of Transportation. Here, this department could own many small bus stands which gives a lower median square footage. 
            
        <br><br>
            
            Thus, this graph gives us a fair understanding of which agencies require more square footage to cater to their needs and functionalities.
