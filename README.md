Data Visualization Assignment 3

This is a small interactive visualization I created for my assignment during my First semester at UIUC for the class 'IS 445 Data Visualiztion'.
I used Jupyter notebook and vega-lite for this visualization. 
This project was all about getting to know how jupyter, vegalite, and github work together. 
Bigger and better visualizations yet to come.

The dataset used is the 'Building Inventory Dataset' from https://data.illinois.gov/dataset/87building_inventory. 
It has a list of all in-use building in the state of illinois. 

The following visualization tells us about which agency has the most square footage owned/acquired till date. A simple sorted bar plot shows the median square footage v/s the corresponding agency name. 
The main motive of this visualization is to take a look at which agency has the most median square footage.
